OVERVIEW:
The Student Grade Tracker is a Java program designed to help manage and track student grades. It provides functionality for users to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculates the average grade, and displays additional information such as the overall grade, letter grade, and GPA.

The program begins by prompting the user to input the number of subjects or assignments for which grades will be entered. Then, it iterates through each subject, allowing the user to input the grade for each. After collecting all the grades, the program calculates the average grade across all subjects.

Once the average grade is calculated, the program determines the corresponding letter grade based on predefined grade ranges and calculates the GPA associated with that letter grade.
Finally, the program displays the average grade, letter grade, and GPA to the user, providing a comprehensive overview of the student's performance.

The Student Grade Tracker provides a simple and efficient solution for managing student grades. By allowing users to input grades for multiple subjects or assignments and providing automatic calculations for the average grade, letter grade, and GPA, the program streamlines the process of tracking and evaluating student performance.

With its user-friendly interface and clear presentation of results, the Student Grade Tracker helps users gain insights into their academic progress and enables educators to efficiently monitor student performance across different subjects or assignments.

Overall, the Student Grade Tracker serves as a valuable tool for students, educators, and administrators alike, facilitating effective grade management and promoting academic success.
